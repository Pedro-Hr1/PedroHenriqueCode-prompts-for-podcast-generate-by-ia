A white man with slicked-back blonde hair, wearing glasses and a professional headset microphone, sitting in front of multiple monitors full of Java code, with a coffee mug on the desk. The background is a modern podcast studio with RGB lights and acoustic panels. The podcast title 'Debugando Java' is displayed in bold, modern font with a slight glitch effect. The style is vibrant, cinematic, and clean, with programmer aesthetics.
